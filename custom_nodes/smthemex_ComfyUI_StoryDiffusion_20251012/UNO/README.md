## üî• News
- [04/2025] üî• The [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bytedance-research/UNO-FLUX) of UNO is released.
- [04/2025] üî• The [training code](https://github.com/bytedance/UNO), [inference code](https://github.com/bytedance/UNO), and [model](https://huggingface.co/bytedance-research/UNO) of UNO are released.
- [04/2025] üî• The [project page](https://bytedance.github.io/UNO) of UNO is created.
- [04/2025] üî• The arXiv [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02160) of UNO is released.

## üìñ Introduction
In this study, we propose a highly-consistent data synthesis pipeline to tackle this challenge. This pipeline harnesses the intrinsic in-context generation capabilities of diffusion transformers and generates high-consistency multi-subject paired data. Additionally, we introduce UNO, which consists of progressive cross-modal alignment and universal rotary position embedding. It is a multi-image conditioned subject-to-image model iteratively trained from a text-to-image model. Extensive experiments show that our method can achieve high consistency while ensuring controllability in both single-subject and multi-subject driven generation.


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

### üîß Requirements and Installation

Install the requirements
```bash
## create a virtual environment with python >= 3.10 <= 3.12, like
# python -m venv uno_env
# source uno_env/bin/activate
# then install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then download checkpoints in one of the three ways:
1. Directly run the inference scripts, the checkpoints will be downloaded automatically by the `hf_hub_download` function in the code to your `$HF_HOME`(the default value is `~/.cache/huggingface`).
2. use `huggingface-cli download <repo name>` to download `black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev`, `xlabs-ai/xflux_text_encoders`, `openai/clip-vit-large-patch14`, `bytedance-research/UNO`, then run the inference scripts.
3. use `huggingface-cli download <repo name> --local-dir <LOCAL_DIR>` to download all the checkpoints menthioned in 2. to the directories your want. Then set the environment variable `AE`, `FLUX`, `T5`, `CLIP`, `LORA` to the corresponding paths. Finally, run the inference scripts.

### üåü Gradio Demo

```bash
python app.py
```


### ‚úçÔ∏è Inference
Start from the examples below to explore and spark your creativity. ‚ú®
```bash
python inference.py --prompt "A clock on the beach is under a red sun umbrella" --image_paths "assets/clock.png" --width 704 --height 704
python inference.py --prompt "The figurine is in the crystal ball" --image_paths "assets/figurine.png" "assets/crystal_ball.png" --width 704 --height 704
python inference.py --prompt "The logo is printed on the cup" --image_paths "assets/cat_cafe.png" "assets/cup.png" --width 704 --height 704
```

Optional prepreration: If you want to test the inference on dreambench at the first time, you should clone the submodule `dreambench` to download the dataset.

```bash
git submodule update --init
```
Then running the following scripts:
```bash
# evaluated on dreambench
## for single-subject
python inference.py --eval_json_path ./datasets/dreambench_singleip.json
## for multi-subject
python inference.py --eval_json_path ./datasets/dreambench_multiip.json
```



### üöÑ Training

```bash
accelerate launch train.py
```


### üìå Tips and Notes
We integrate single-subject and multi-subject generation within a unified model. For single-subject scenarios, the longest side of the reference image is set to 512 by default, while for multi-subject scenarios, it is set to 320. UNO demonstrates remarkable flexibility across various aspect ratios, thanks to its training on a multi-scale dataset. Despite being trained within 512 buckets, it can handle higher resolutions, including 512, 568, and 704, among others.

UNO excels in subject-driven generation but has room for improvement in generalization due to dataset constraints. We are actively developing an enhanced model‚Äîstay tuned for updates. Your feedback is valuable, so please feel free to share any suggestions.
