# DualCLIPLoaderGGUFDisTorchMultiGPU

> **Deprecated**: DisTorch V1 legacy nodes are no longer supported. Please migrate to [DualCLIPLoaderGGUFDisTorch2MultiGPU](DualCLIPLoaderGGUFDisTorch2MultiGPU.md) for maintained functionality.

This documentation is retained for reference only. Use the DisTorch2 version above for dual GGUF CLIP workflows with modern allocation support.
