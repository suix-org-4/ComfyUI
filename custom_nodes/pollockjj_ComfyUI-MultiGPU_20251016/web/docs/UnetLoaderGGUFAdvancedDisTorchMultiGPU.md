# UnetLoaderGGUFAdvancedDisTorchMultiGPU

> **Deprecated**: DisTorch V1 legacy nodes are no longer supported. Please migrate to [UnetLoaderGGUFAdvancedDisTorch2MultiGPU](UnetLoaderGGUFAdvancedDisTorch2MultiGPU.md) for maintained functionality.

This legacy documentation is preserved only for reference. All new setups should switch to the DisTorch2-based loader noted above to receive current fixes and allocation features.
