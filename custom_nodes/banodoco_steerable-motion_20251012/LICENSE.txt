Open Source Native License (OSNL)
Version 0.1 - March 1, 2024

Preamble

The Open Source Native License (OSNL) is designed to ensure that software remains free and open, fostering innovation and knowledge sharing within the community. It grants individuals, researchers, and commercial entities who open source their primary business assets, the freedom to use the software in any manner they choose.

This distinctive approach aims to balance the benefits of open-source development with the realities of commercial enterprise. It ensures that software remains a shared, community-driven resource while enabling businesses to thrive in an open-source ecosystem. Additional licenses are available for non-open source commercial entities.
