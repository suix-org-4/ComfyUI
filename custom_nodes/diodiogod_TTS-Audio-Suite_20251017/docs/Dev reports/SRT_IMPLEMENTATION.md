## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage in ComfyUI
1. **Add the node**: Search for `ðŸŽ¤ ChatterBox SRT Voice TTS` in ComfyUI
2. **Paste SRT content** into the `srt_content` field:
   ```srt
   1
   00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
   Hello world! This is my first subtitle.
   
   2
   00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
   This is the second subtitle with perfect timing.
   ```
3. **Select timing mode**: Choose `stretch_to_fit` for beginners
4. **Set voice parameters**: Adjust exaggeration (0.5), temperature (0.7), etc.
5. **Connect outputs**: Link `audio` output to PreviewAudio or SaveAudio node
6. **Execute** to generate timed audio

### Advanced Usage Examples

#### Voice Cloning with SRT
**Best for:** Personalized voice with subtitle timing
- **Timing Mode**: Select `smart_natural` (best balance)
- **Reference Audio**: Connect LoadAudio node with your voice sample
- **Use Case**: Creating personalized narration or dubbing

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. SRT Parser Module (`chatterbox/srt_parser.py`)
```python
class SRTSubtitle:
    """Data class representing a single subtitle entry"""
    sequence: int
    start_time: float
    end_time: float
    text: str

class SRTParser:
    """Main parser for SRT format with comprehensive error handling"""
    def parse_srt_content(content: str) -> List[SRTSubtitle]
    def parse_srt_file(file_path: str) -> List[SRTSubtitle]
```

**Features:**
- Parses standard SRT format (sequence, timestamps, text)
- Validates timing (no overlaps, reasonable durations)
- Handles multiple encodings (UTF-8, Latin-1, etc.)
- Removes HTML tags and normalizes text
- Provides timing statistics and analysis

#### 2. Audio Timing Utilities (`chatterbox/audio_timing.py`)
```python
class AudioTimingUtils:
    """Basic timing conversion and audio manipulation utilities"""

class PhaseVocoderTimeStretcher:
    """Advanced time-stretching using phase vocoder"""

class TimedAudioAssembler:
    """Assembles audio segments with precise timing"""
```

#### 3. ComfyUI Node Integration

- `generation_info`: Summary of generation process
- `timing_report`: Detailed timing analysis and adjustments
- `adjusted_srt`: Actual final SRT timings after all adjustments

### Timing Modes Detailed

#### 1. Stretch to Fit (`stretch_to_fit`)
- **Best for:** Video dubbing requiring exact timing
- Uses phase vocoder to time-stretch audio to match SRT timing exactly
- Preserves pitch while adjusting duration
- May reduce audio quality with aggressive stretching

#### 2. Pad with Silence (`pad_with_silence`)
- **Best for:** Presentations with natural pacing
- Generates audio at natural pace
- Adds silence gaps between subtitles to match timing
- Preserves natural speech rhythm and quality

#### 3. Smart Natural Timing (`smart_natural`)
- **Best for:** Balanced natural speech with timing constraints
- Prioritizes natural speech rhythm
- Attempts to accommodate longer audio by consuming gaps
- Shifts subsequent segments forward when possible
- Falls back to time stretching or padding as needed

### Advanced Features

#### Segment-Level Caching
- Caches individual audio segments for efficiency
- Only regenerates modified segments
- Audio not regenerated if only timings change
- Significantly improves processing time for iterative adjustments

#### Sample Accuracy
- All timing calculations are sample-accurate
- Supports arbitrary sample rates
- Precise positioning within audio buffers
- No cumulative timing drift

#### Memory Efficiency
- Processes audio segments individually
- Streaming assembly for large projects
- Minimal memory footprint for long content

## Performance & Considerations

### Performance Characteristics

#### Time Stretching Performance
- **CPU-intensive:** Phase vocoder requires significant processing
- **No GPU acceleration:** Time stretching runs on CPU only
- **Alternative:** Use `pad_with_silence` for faster generation
- **Recommendation:** Batch processing for large projects

#### Memory Usage
- Memory usage scales with audio length
- Long subtitles may require more memory
- Consider splitting very long content into chunks

#### Quality vs. Precision Trade-offs
- **`stretch_to_fit`:** Lower quality, precise timing, no overlap
- **`pad_with_silence`:** Best quality, precise timing, may have gaps  
- **`smart_natural`:** Variable quality, adaptive timing, may truncate

### SRT Format Support

#### Supported Format
```srt
1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
First subtitle text here

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,200
Second subtitle text
can span multiple lines

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Third subtitle with <i>HTML tags</i> (automatically removed)
```

#### Validation Rules
- âœ… Sequence numbers must be positive integers
- âœ… Timestamps in format `HH:MM:SS,mmm --> HH:MM:SS,mmm`
- âœ… Start time must be before end time
- âœ… No overlapping subtitles allowed
- âœ… Duration limits: 0.1s minimum, 30s maximum recommended
- âœ… Text cannot be empty after cleanup

#### Error Handling
- Comprehensive parsing error messages
- Encoding detection (UTF-8, Latin-1, CP1252)
- HTML tag removal and whitespace normalization
- Timing validation with detailed error reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### SRT Parsing Errors
**Problem:** Invalid SRT format
**Solutions:**
- Check SRT format (sequence, timing, text structure)
- Verify timestamp format: `HH:MM:SS,mmm --> HH:MM:SS,mmm`
- Ensure no overlapping subtitles
- Check for empty text after HTML removal

#### Time Stretching Issues
**Problem:** Poor audio quality with stretching
**Solutions:**
- Reduce `max_stretch_ratio` (try 1.5 instead of 2.0)
- Use `pad_with_silence` mode for very aggressive timing requirements
- Check that `scipy` is properly installed

#### Memory Issues
**Problem:** Out of memory errors
**Solutions:**
- Split long SRT files into smaller segments
- Reduce audio quality if possible
- Process in smaller batches

#### Import Errors
**Problem:** Module not found errors
**Solutions:**
- Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that `chatterbox` modules are in the correct location
- Ensure ComfyUI can find the node files
