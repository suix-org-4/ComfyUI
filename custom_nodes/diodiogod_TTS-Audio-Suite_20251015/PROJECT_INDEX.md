# TTS Audio Suite - Project Index

*Comprehensive file index for the universal multi-engine TTS extension for ComfyUI*

## Architecture Overview

This extension features a **unified modular architecture** supporting multiple TTS engines:
- **Unified Node Interface**: Single set of nodes (TTS Text, TTS SRT, Voice Changer) that work with any engine via clean delegation
- **ComfyUI Model Management Integration**: All TTS models now integrate with ComfyUI's native model management system, enabling "Clear VRAM" functionality and automatic memory management
- **Universal Model Loading System**: Standardized model loading interface across all engines (ChatterBox, F5-TTS, Higgs Audio, VibeVoice, RVC, Audio Separation) with fallback support
- **Engine Processors**: Internal processing engines for each TTS system (ChatterBox, F5-TTS, Higgs Audio, VibeVoice) handling engine-specific orchestration
- **Engine Adapters**: Modular adapters for ChatterBox, F5-TTS, Higgs Audio 2, VibeVoice, and RVC voice conversion
- **Centralized Download System**: Unified downloader eliminates HuggingFace cache duplication with direct downloads to organized TTS/ folder structure, with full extra_model_paths.yaml support for shared model directories
- **Thread-Safe Architecture**: Stateless ChatterBox wrapper eliminates shared state corruption (Note: parallel processing is slower than sequential)
- **Universal Streaming Infrastructure**: Unified streaming system with configurable workers (batch_size parameter) - sequential mode (batch_size=0) recommended for optimal performance
- **Multilingual Support**: German and Norwegian models for ChatterBox, plus ChatterBox Official 23-Lang supporting 23 languages including Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Swahili, and Turkish
- **Smart Language Grouping**: SRT processing by language groups to minimize model switching
- **Character Voice Management**: Centralized character voice system with flexible input types
- **Comprehensive Audio Processing**: Interactive waveform analyzer, vocal separation, and audio mixing

## Architecture Summary

The TTS Audio Suite follows a **unified modular architecture** where:

1. **Engine Nodes** (`nodes/engines/`) provide user configuration interfaces
2. **Unified Nodes** (`nodes/unified/`) serve as clean delegation layers routing to appropriate engine processors  
3. **Engine Processors** (`nodes/chatterbox/`, `nodes/f5tts/`, `nodes/higgs_audio/`) handle engine-specific orchestration and workflow logic
4. **Engine Implementations** (`engines/`) handle the actual TTS/VC processing and model inference
5. **Adapters** (`engines/adapters/`) bridge low-level engines to higher-level processors
6. **Utilities** (`utils/`) provide shared functionality across all components
7. **Web Interface** (`web/`) enables interactive features like audio analysis

This layered design ensures consistent user experience while allowing engine-specific optimizations. The unified nodes act as thin delegation layers, eliminating code duplication and maintaining architectural consistency across all TTS engines.
