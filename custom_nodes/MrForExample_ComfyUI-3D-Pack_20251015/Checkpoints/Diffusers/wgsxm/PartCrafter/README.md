# PartCrafter: Structured 3D Mesh Generation via Compositional Latent Diffusion Transformers

PartCrafter is a structured 3D generative model that jointly generates multiple parts and objects from a single RGB image in one shot.
This HuggingFaceðŸ¤— repo stores pretrained model weights for PartCrafter on **object level**. 

For more details about usage, please refer to the [official GitHub repo](https://github.com/wgsxm/PartCrafter).
