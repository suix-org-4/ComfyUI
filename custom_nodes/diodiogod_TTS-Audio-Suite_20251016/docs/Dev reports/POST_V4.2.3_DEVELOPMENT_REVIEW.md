## Major Architectural Implementations

### 1. Universal Streaming System (Commits: 5308ba8, 904c965, 994ba16, 95b56c9)

**Problem Solved**: Each engine/node type required custom streaming routers and format conversions, creating maintenance nightmare and preventing code reuse.

**Solution**: Complete universal streaming architecture in `utils/streaming/`:

**New Files Created**:
- `utils/streaming/streaming_coordinator.py` - Universal coordinator replacing all format-specific routers
- `utils/streaming/streaming_interface.py` - Abstract streaming interface for engine adapters
- `utils/streaming/streaming_types.py` - Universal data structures eliminating format conversions
- `utils/streaming/work_queue_processor.py` - Engine-agnostic parallel processing system
- `engines/adapters/chatterbox_streaming_adapter.py` - ChatterBox streaming bridge
- `engines/adapters/f5tts_streaming_adapter.py` - F5-TTS streaming adapter with language switching

**Technical Benefits**:
- Single `StreamingSegment` data structure for all engines
- No more tuple/dict format conversions between engines
- Engine adapters provide clean abstraction layer
- Future engines require only adapter implementation

### 2. Stateless ChatterBox Wrapper (Commits: 565a525, 83a575c, 98df4ef)

**Problem Solved**: ChatterBox model shared state corruption in parallel processing caused crashes and audio artifacts.

**Solution**: Complete stateless wrapper system:

**Key Implementation**:
- `engines/chatterbox/stateless_wrapper.py` - Thread-safe stateless wrapper
- `engines/chatterbox/streaming_model_manager.py` - Pre-loading and management system
- Eliminates shared `self.conds` state corruption
- Fresh condition calculation for each generation
- Comprehensive tensor detaching for autograd safety

**Results**:
- **Thread-Safe Parallel Generation**: No more shared state corruption
- **Batch Size Control**: User can control worker count via batch_size parameter (though sequential remains faster)
- **Memory Safety**: Proper tensor management prevents GPU memory leaks
- **Performance Reality**: Parallel processing divides inference throughput among workers, making it slower than sequential

### 3. Smart Model Loading System (Commits: df4903b, 89da0f0, c9d24e7)

**Problem Solved**: Multiple engines loading duplicate language models causing memory exhaustion and allocation failures.

**Solution**: Universal smart model loader:

**Key Implementation**:
- `utils/models/smart_loader.py` - Universal SmartModelLoader preventing duplicates
- Cross-engine model sharing (ChatterBox ↔ F5-TTS)
- Cross-mode model sharing (traditional ↔ streaming)
- Unified logging and error handling

**Memory Benefits**:
- **No Duplicate Models**: Same language model reused across all contexts
- **Efficient Switching**: Faster transitions between batch_size modes
- **Memory Pressure Relief**: Prevents GPU allocation failures

### 4. Centralized Cache Architecture (Commits: 5d9b285, 2b6a7aa, 74eebda, 46dc41e)

**Problem Solved**: Inconsistent caching between engines and processing modes preventing cache hits.

**Solution**: Unified caching system:

**Key Implementation**:
- `utils/audio/audio_hash.py` - Centralized content-based hashing
- Content hashing eliminates unreliable temp file path dependencies
- Unified cache interface across all TTS nodes and modes
- Cache sharing between streaming and traditional methods

**Performance Benefits**:
- **100% Cache Hit Reliability**: Same content produces same cache key
- **Cross-Mode Cache Sharing**: Traditional and streaming modes share cache
- **Voice Change Detection**: Proper cache invalidation for narrator voice changes

### 5. Enhanced Multilingual Processing (Commits: d126c91, 8ce396c, 2ea967e, 6df656e)

**Problem Solved**: Critical regression where German/Norwegian segments sounded English despite logs showing correct models.

**Root Cause**: Multilingual engine loading English tokenizer first, then caching it for all languages.

**Solution**: Complete multilingual processing overhaul:

**Technical Fixes**:
- Character alias system preservation for language-only tags
- Correct language model loading order (target language first, not English default)
- Model instance switching ensuring `self.tts_model` points to correct cached model
- Cache character parameter fixes for language-only tags

**Quality Improvements**:
- **Perfect Language Switching**: Each language uses its correct model
- **Character Voice Priority**: Main narrator voice prioritized over aliases for language tags
- **Tokenizer Consistency**: Correct language tokenizer loaded for each segment

## Streaming Parallel Processing Implementation

### ChatterBox Engine (Commits: 4ac4f4d, f86754b, 1bd454d, b107389)

- **Batch Processor**: `engines/chatterbox/batch_processor.py` with ThreadPoolExecutor
- **SRT Router**: `engines/chatterbox/srt_batch_processing_router.py`
- **Streaming Infrastructure**: Multiple processors and work queues

**Implementation Results**:
- **SRT Processing**: 26 segments can be processed in parallel with 9 workers (but slower than sequential)
- **Character-Aware Batching**: Segments grouped by character for theoretical efficiency
- **Model Pre-loading**: Eliminates fallback warnings during streaming
- **Performance Reality**: Parallel processing proved slower due to inference throughput division
