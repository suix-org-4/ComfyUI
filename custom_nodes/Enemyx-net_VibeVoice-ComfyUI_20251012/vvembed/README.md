# Embedded VibeVoice

This folder contains the embedded VibeVoice code from Microsoft.

## Why Embedded?

The original VibeVoice repository (https://github.com/microsoft/VibeVoice) has been removed from GitHub. Since VibeVoice is licensed under MIT, we have embedded the code here to ensure continued functionality of the ComfyUI wrapper.

## License

The code in this folder is licensed under the MIT License (see LICENSE file). Original copyright belongs to Microsoft Corporation.

## Modifications

The only modifications made to the original code are:
- Changed absolute imports from `vibevoice` to relative imports
- No functional changes to the core logic

## Note

This is a preservation copy to ensure the continued availability of VibeVoice for the ComfyUI community.
