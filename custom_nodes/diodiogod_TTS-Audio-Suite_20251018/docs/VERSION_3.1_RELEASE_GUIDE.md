# Version 3.1 Release Guide

## Overview
Version 3.1 introduces major new features: **Character Switching System** and **Overlapping Subtitles Support**. This represents a significant enhancement to the TTS capabilities.

---

## üé≠ Major Features Added

### 1. Character Switching System
**Universal character switching for all TTS nodes using `[Character]` tags**

**Core Components:**
- `core/character_parser.py` - Universal text parsing with line-by-line processing
- Enhanced `core/voice_discovery.py` - Character voice discovery with flat file + folder support
- Character alias mapping system with `character_alias_map.json` files

**Integration:**
- ‚úÖ F5TTS Voice Generation node
- ‚úÖ ChatterBox Voice TTS node  
- ‚úÖ F5TTS SRT Voice Generation node
- ‚úÖ ChatterBox SRT Voice TTS node

**Features:**
- Line-by-line character parsing (fixes narrator fallback)
- Support for both folder structure and flat files
- Character alias mapping (`"Bob": "Clint_Eastwood CC3 (enhanced2)"`)
- Priority system: `models/voices/` overrides `voices_examples/`
- Robust fallback to narrator for unknown characters
- Preserves all existing functionality (caching, chunking)

### 2. Overlapping Subtitles Support
**Natural conversation patterns with overlapping dialogue**

**Implementation:**
- SRT parser now allows overlaps by default (`allow_overlaps=True`)
- Smart timing mode fallback system
- Enhanced audio assembly for overlapping segments

**Mode Behavior:**
- `stretch_to_fit`: Allows overlaps, stretches each segment to exact timing
- `pad_with_silence`: Naturally handles overlaps (places audio at start times)
- `smart_natural`: Auto-fallbacks to `pad_with_silence` when overlaps detected

# üé≠ ChatterBox Voice v3.1.0 - Character Switching & Overlapping Subtitles

## üåü Major New Features

### Character Switching System
Transform your TTS with seamless character switching using simple `[Character]` tags!

**Example Usage:**
```
Hello! This is the narrator speaking.
[Alice] Hi there! I'm Alice with my unique voice.
[Bob] And I'm Bob! Great to meet you both.
Back to the narrator for the conclusion.
```

**Key Features:**
- **Universal Support**: Works across all TTS nodes (F5TTS, ChatterBox, SRT)
- **Character Aliases**: Map simple names to complex filenames
  ```json
  {
    "Bob": "Clint_Eastwood CC3 (enhanced2)",
    "Alice": "female_01"
  }
  ```
- **Flexible Voice Organization**: Support for both folder structure and flat files
- **Robust Fallback**: Unknown characters gracefully use narrator voice
- **Performance Optimized**: Character-aware caching system

### Overlapping Subtitles Support
Create natural conversation patterns with overlapping dialogue!

**Example SRT:**
```srt
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
[BGpeople] Background chatter continues...

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500  
[Bob] Oh Hello Alice!

3
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,000
[Alice] Hey Bob! How are you?
```

**Smart Mode Handling:**
- `stretch_to_fit`: Allows overlaps with exact timing
- `pad_with_silence`: Naturally handles overlapping audio
- `smart_natural`: Auto-switches to `pad_with_silence` when overlaps detected

## üìñ Documentation
