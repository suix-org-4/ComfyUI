Universally applicable inpainting ability for every model. LanPaint sampler lets the model "think" through multiple iterations before denoising, enabling you to invest more computation time for superior inpainting quality.  

This is the official implementation of ["Lanpaint: Training-Free Diffusion Inpainting with Exact and Fast Conditional Inference"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03491), accepted by TMLR. The repository is for ComfyUI extension. Local Python benchmark code is published here: [LanPaintBench](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaintBench).

**🎬 NEW: LanPaint now supports video inpainting and outpainting based on Wan 2.2!**

## Features

- **Universal Compatibility** – Works instantly with almost any model (**SD 1.5, XL, 3.5, Flux, HiDream, Qwen-Image, Wan2.2 or custom LoRAs**) and ControlNet.  
![Inpainting Result 13](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/blob/master/examples/InpaintChara_13.jpg) 
- **No Training Needed** – Works out of the box with your existing model.  
- **Easy to Use** – Same workflow as standard ComfyUI KSampler.  
- **Flexible Masking** – Supports any mask shape, size, or position for inpainting/outpainting.  
- **No Workarounds** – Generates 100% new content (no blending or smoothing) without relying on partial denoising.  
- **Beyond Inpainting** – You can even use it as a simple way to generate consistent characters. 

**Warning**: LanPaint has degraded performance on distillation models, such as Flux.dev, due to a similar [issue with LORA training](https://medium.com/@zhiwangshi28/why-flux-lora-so-hard-to-train-and-how-to-overcome-it-a0c70bc59eaf). Please use low flux guidance (1.0-2.0) to mitigate this [issue](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/issues/30).

## Quickstart

1. **Install ComfyUI**: Follow the official [ComfyUI installation guide](https://docs.comfy.org/get_started) to set up ComfyUI on your system. Or ensure your ComfyUI version > 0.3.11.
2. **Install ComfyUI-Manager**: Add the [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) for easy extension management.  
3. **Install LanPaint Nodes**:  
   - **Via ComfyUI-Manager**: Search for "[LanPaint](https://registry.comfy.org/publishers/scraed/nodes/LanPaint)" in the manager and install it directly.  
   - **Manually**: Click "Install via Git URL" in ComfyUI-Manager and input the GitHub repository link:  
     ```
     https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint.git
     ```  
     Alternatively, clone this repository into the `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` folder.  
4. **Restart ComfyUI**: Restart ComfyUI to load the LanPaint nodes.  

Once installed, you'll find the LanPaint nodes under the "sampling" category in ComfyUI. Use them just like the default KSampler for high-quality inpainting!


## **How to Use Examples:**  
1. Navigate to the **example** folder (i.e example_1), download all pictures.  
2. Drag **InPainted_Drag_Me_to_ComfyUI.png** into ComfyUI to load the workflow.  
3. Download the required model (i.e clicking **Model Used in This Example**).  
4. Load the model in ComfyUI.
5. Upload **Masked_Load_Me_in_Loader.png** to the **"Load image"** node in the **"Mask image for inpainting"** group (second from left), or the **Prepare Image** node.  
7. Queue the task, you will get inpainted results from LanPaint. Some example also gives you inpainted results from the following methods for comparison:
   - **[VAE Encode for Inpainting](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/inpaint/)**
   - **[Set Latent Noise Mask](https://comfyui-wiki.com/en/tutorial/basic/how-to-inpaint-an-image-in-comfyui)**

## Video Examples (Beta)

LanPaint now supports video inpainting with Wan 2.2, enabling you to seamlessly inpaint masked regions across video frames while maintaining temporal consistency.

**Note:** LanPaint supports video inpainting for longer sequences (e.g., 81 frames), but processing time increases significantly (please check the [Resource Consumption](#resource-consumption) section for details) and performance may become unstable. For optimal results and stability, we recommend limiting video inpainting to **40 frames or fewer**.

### Wan 2.2 Video Inpainting 

*Example: Wan2.2 t2v 14B, 480p video (11:6), 40 frames, LanPaint K Sampler, 2 steps of thinking*

| Original Video | Mask (Add a white hat) | Inpainted Result |

## Image Examples

### Example Wan2.2: InPaint(LanPaint K Sampler, 5 steps of thinking)
We are excited to announce that LanPaint now supports Wan2.2 text to image generation with Wan2.2 T2V model.

### Example Wan2.2: Partial InPaint(LanPaint K Sampler, 5 steps of thinking)
Sometimes we don't want to inpaint completely new content, but rather let the inpainted image reference the original image. One option to achieve this is to inpaint with an edit model like Qwen Image Edit. Another option is to perform a partial inpaint: allowing the diffusion process to start at some middle steps rather than from 0.

## Usage

**Workflow Setup**  
Same as default ComfyUI KSampler - simply replace with LanPaint KSampler nodes. The inpainting workflow is the same as the [SetLatentNoiseMask](https://comfyui-wiki.com/zh/comfyui-nodes/latent/inpaint/set-latent-noise-mask) inpainting workflow.

**Note**
- LanPaint requires binary masks (values of 0 or 1) without opacity or smoothing. To ensure compatibility, set the mask's **opacity and hardness to maximum** in your mask editor. During inpainting, any mask with smoothing or gradients will automatically be converted to a binary mask.
- LanPaint relies heavily on your text prompts to guide inpainting - explicitly describe the content you want generated in the masked area. If results show artifacts or mismatched elements, counteract them with targeted negative prompts.

## Basic Sampler
![Samplers](https://github.com/scraed/LanPaint/blob/master/Nodes.JPG)  

- LanPaint KSampler: The most basic and easy to use sampler for inpainting.
- LanPaint KSampler (Advanced): Full control of all parameters.

### LanPaint KSampler
Simplified interface with recommended defaults:

- Steps: 20 - 50. More steps will give more "thinking" and better results.
- LanPaint NumSteps: The turns of thinking before denoising. Recommend 5 for most of tasks ( which means 5 times slower than sampling without thinking). Use 10 for more challenging tasks. 
- LanPaint Prompt mode: Image First mode and Prompt First mode. Image First mode focuses on the image, inpaint based on image context (maybe ignore prompt), while Prompt First mode focuses more on the prompt. Use Prompt First mode for tasks like character consistency. (Technically, it Prompt First mode change CFG scale to negative value in the BIG score to emphasis prompt, which will costs image quality.)

### LanPaint KSampler (Advanced)
Full parameter control:
**Key Parameters**

| Parameter | Range | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `Steps` | 0-100 | Total steps of diffusion sampling. Higher means better inpainting. Recommend 20-50. |
| `LanPaint_NumSteps` | 0-20 | Reasoning iterations per denoising step ("thinking depth"). Easy task: 2-5. Hard task: 5-10 |
| `LanPaint_Lambda` | 0.1-50 | Content alignment strength (higher = stricter). Recommend 4.0 - 10.0 |
| `LanPaint_StepSize` | 0.1-1.0 | The StepSize of each thinking step. Recommend 0.1-0.5. |
| `LanPaint_Beta` | 0.1-2.0 | The StepSize ratio between masked / unmasked region. Small value can compensate high lambda values. Recommend 1.0 |
| `LanPaint_Friction` | 0.0-100.0 | The friction of Langevin dynamics. Higher means more slow but stable, lower means fast but unstable. Recommend 10.0 - 20.0|
| `LanPaint_EarlyStop` | 0-10 | Stop LanPaint iteration before the final sampling step. Helps to remove artifacts in some cases. Recommend 1-5|
| `LanPaint_PromptMode` | Image First / Prompt First | Image First mode focuses on the image context, maybe ignore prompt. Prompt First mode focuses more on the prompt. |

For detailed descriptions of each parameter, simply hover your mouse over the corresponding input field to view tooltips with additional information.

### LanPaint Mask Blend
This node blends the original image with the inpainted image based on the mask. It is useful if you want the unmasked region to match the original image pixel perfectly.

## LanPaint KSampler (Advanced) Tuning Guide
For challenging inpainting tasks:  

1️⃣ **Boost Quality**
Increase **total number of sampling steps** (very important!), **LanPaint_NumSteps** (thinking iterations) or **LanPaint_Lambda** if the inpainted result does not meet your expectations.
  
2️⃣ **Boost Speed**
Decrease **LanPaint_NumSteps** to accelerate generation! If you want better results but still need fewer steps, consider:
    - **Increasing LanPaint_StepSize** to speed up the thinking process.
    - **Decreasing LanPaint_Friction** to make the Langevin dynamics converges more faster.
    
3️⃣ **Fix Unstability**:  
If you find the results have wired texture, try
- Reduce **LanPaint_Friction** to make the Langevin dynamics more stable. 
- Reduce **LanPaint_StepSize** to use smaller step size.
- Reduce **LanPaint_Beta** if you are using a high lambda value.

⚠️ **Notes**:  
- For effective tuning, **fix the seed** and adjust parameters incrementally while observing the results. This helps isolate the impact of each setting.  Better to do it with a batche of images to avoid overfitting on a single image.
